<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>

<p>That it is being warranted and represented by those accessing the Portal or acting upon the information available on the Portal or providing any updations hereunder this Portal that the administrators/ operators of the Portal are just facilitators/ consolidators/ aggregators of the list concerning the database of unethical employees based upon the records available with the concerned employers exclusively and in no circumstance shall the said administrators/ operators of the Portal be held to be liable or responsible for any false or untrue information or claims by any person as to the names appearing in said database particularly when the Portal is being created with an intent to avoid infusion of the unethical employees based on the records available with the concerned employers exclusively and not to vilify the image of any person. Also when the said updation is in furtherance of the beneficial cause to avoid placement of unethical employees in the industry. It is being thoroughly acknowledged by the users of the Portal that the administrators/ or operators are to be held harmless incase of any unwarranted claims or disputes raised by anyone, as to the information/ database maintained on Portal</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions</strong><strong>:</strong></p>

<p>Created with and motivated by the beneficial cause to avoid placement of Unethical Employees and benefit the logistic industry players, more particularly the society at large, the companies falling under the said logistic umbrella are encouraged to update the list of said Unethical Employees based on honest revelations as per the records available with them and further make consistent efforts to populate the database and propagate the said effort so that maximum benefit can be derived by the implementation of the said beneficial cause hereunder this Portal</p>

<p>Further the best employers practice demands that while updation at the Portal, the concerned employers understand a clear cut differentiation between non performance and unethical conduct as categorised hereunder this Portal since non performance is very subjective/ contextual in nature and any such updation based on the said criteria can have an adverse impact on the career of the concerned employee</p>

<p>Also under the appointment letters to be issued to the employees, the employers may reserve a right to themselves for updation of name of employee on Portal incase where employee is found to be unethical or leaves the company without complying with post termination obligations thereby promoting ethical conduct amongst employees</p>
